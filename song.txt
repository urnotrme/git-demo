You'll never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
Have to let go
He won't be the one to cry

Let's not kill the Karma
Let's not start a fight
It's not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it (Ha ha ha)
It's not worth our time
We can live without him
Just a beautiful liar

We never know
When the pain and heartbreaks over
Have to let go
The innocence is gone
